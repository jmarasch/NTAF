Bomb Making|When making a bomb you first need to select a shell for this example I will use a standard casing this shell has 3 units, each item put into a shell will take up space this space is defined by units. I will then decide to fill the case with 3 “explosive fillings” to do this you need to roll 1d12 under the models average wp and ag ( (wp+ag)/2 ) if successful you’ll have just made a standard grenade and saved 5 tabs its not much but it is kind of like buy 4 get one free. The only time you roll is after your done putting the bomb together. If you roll a 12 the bomb explodes in the models face causing damage equal to what would happen on the battle field if its enough to kill it the model has died the model will only completely recover at the start of the next battle damage between fights is cumulative, if you roll under the models Wp & Ag average you have successfully made a bomb, if you roll equal to the average or above the bomb is a dud and must be discarded losing everything you put in to it.||Arsonist|Human, Mutant, Undead, Genics_B, Aquatic, Fun|Arsonists|100|

Poker chips are a good way to do this, on a separate sheet write down some numbers (one to however many Traps you can set) then write down what traps are what numbers. Take out some poker chips with corresponding numbers. when you play a scenario that allows traps everyone but the player setting traps leaves the room. The numbered tokens are placed face down on the game board. On the sheet of paper with the numbers write down what each trap is and what it does. Then that same person lays the treasure tokens down face down on the board. If multiple people can lay traps the number of total allowed traps are divided equally and treasure tokens to be place are layer down are equally divided, players take turns leavening the room to set up traps or treasure. Ex player one lays one trap, player two comes in and lays one treasure, player one comes back in and lays one treasure, player two, so on and so fourth till all traps and treasure are placed.||TrapSetter|Human, Genics_A, Genics_B, Demonic, Fun|Trap Setter|100|
