  <Description>When making a bomb you first need to select a shell for this example I will use a standard casing this shell has 3 units, each item put into a shell will take up space this space is defined by units. I will then decide to fill the case with 3 “explosive fillings” to do this you need to roll 1d12 under the models average wp and ag ( (wp+ag)/2 ) if successful you’ll have just made a standard grenade and saved 5 tabs its not much but it is kind of like buy 4 get one free. The only time you roll is after your done putting the bomb together. If you roll a 12 the bomb explodes in the models face causing damage equal to what would happen on the battle field if its enough to kill it the model has died the model will only completely recover at the start of the next battle damage between fights is cumulative, if you roll under the models Wp &amp; Ag average you have successfully made a bomb, if you roll equal to the average or above the bomb is a dud and must be discarded losing everything you put in to it.</Description>
