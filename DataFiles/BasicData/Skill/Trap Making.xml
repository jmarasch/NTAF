  <Description>When Playing with traps its important t know where your traps are and what they are. Poker chips are a good way to do this, on a separate sheet write down some numbers (one to however many Traps you can set) then write down what traps are what numbers. Take out some poker chips with corresponding numbers. when you play a scenario that allows traps everyone but the player setting traps leaves the room. The numbered tokens are placed face down on the game board. On the sheet of paper with the numbers write down what each trap is and what it does. Then that same person lays the treasure tokens down face down on the board. If multiple people can lay traps the number of total allowed traps are divided equally and treasure tokens to be place are layer down are equally divided, players take turns leavening the room to set up traps or treasure. Ex player one lays one trap, player two comes in and lays one treasure, player one comes back in and lays one treasure, player two, so on and so fourth till all traps and treasure are placed.</Description>
